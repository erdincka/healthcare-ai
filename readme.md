For the backend, deploy the 4 models below according to the instruction.

Then deploy the frontend application by importing the framework found in the frontend folder. During the import process make sure to configure your serving endpoints either during import or later via the GUI by updating the values yaml via the user interface.

## Instructions to prepare models

Instructions to get medgemma working from MLIS (a framework located within HPE Private Cloud AI, AI Essentials interface):

    registry: none
    model format: custom
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.9.0
    arguments: --model google/medgemma-4b-it --port 8080
    advanced options add parameter: HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN [mytoken]


Instructions to get medreason working from MLIS (a framework located within HPE Private Cloud AI, AI Essentials interface): 
    
    registry: none
    model format: custom
    image: vllm/vllm-openai:latest
    arguments: --model UCSC-VLAA/MedReason-8B --port 8080


Instructions to get whisper working from MLIS (a framework located within HPE Private Cloud AI, AI Essentials interface):

    registry: none
    model format: custom
    image: davemcmahon/vllm-with-audio:latest
    arguments: --model openai/whisper-large-v3 --port 8080

Instructions to get NLLB working from MLIS (a framework located within HPE Private Cloud AI, AI Essentials interface):

    registry: none
    model format: custom
    image: davemcmahon/nllb-translator
    resources: 
        cpu: 1 -> 4
        memory: 2Gi - 8Gi
        gpu: 0 -> 0
    arguments: none
    environmental variables: 
        HF_HOME: "/mnt/models/.cache"
        TRANSFORMERS_CACHE: "/mnt/models/.cache"

    
Alternative instructions to deploy CPU optimised NLLB translation model loaded via kServe (open source model serving solution included within the kubeflow framework):

    As kubectl admin, kubectl apply -f nllb-translator.yaml (found in "nllb_deployment" folder)
    First change the namespace within the yaml to reflect your environment
    Test with "nllb_test" notebook
